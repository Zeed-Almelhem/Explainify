# XAI Web App Planning Document

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a comprehensive web application for Explainable AI (XAI) that enables users to understand and interpret machine learning model predictions. The app will allow users to upload datasets and trained models, then generate visual explanations, feature importance metrics, and identify influential training examples for any given prediction.

## Scope

### Core Functionality

   - Support for XGBoost, LightGBM models
   - Support for TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch models (via SHAP DeepExplainer)
   - Model serialization format support (.pkl, .joblib, .h5, SavedModel)

2. **Data Handling**:
   - CSV, Excel, and Parquet file uploads for training and test data
   - Automatic feature type detection and preprocessing
   - Dataset validation and sanitization
   - Training/test data management system

3. **Explanation Methods**:
   - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
     - TreeExplainer for tree-based models
     - KernelExplainer for model-agnostic explanations
     - DeepExplainer for neural networks
     - Force plots, summary plots, dependence plots
   
   - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**:
     - Local feature contribution explanations
     - Text and tabular data explanations
     - Image explanation capabilities (future phase)
   
   - **ELI5**:
     - Feature weights visualization
     - Text classifier explanation
     - Permutation importance metrics
   
   - **Alibi**:
     - Counterfactual explanations
     - Anchor explanations (rules that sufficiently "anchor" a prediction)
     - Prototype counterfactuals
   
   - **InterpretML**:
     - Global Explanation Dashboard
     - Glassbox models (EBMs, Decision Trees)

4. **Visualization Components**:
   - Interactive waterfall charts for local explanations
   - Feature importance bar plots
   - PDP/ICE plots for feature interactions
   - Counterfactual examples visualization
   - Decision tree visualization

### Technical Scope Boundaries
- Primary focus on tabular data (first phase)
- Support for classification and regression problems
- Text and image data support in later phases
- Maximum dataset size limit of 100MB for initial version
